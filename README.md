Better Gmail Unsubscribe
========================

Gmail offers an unsubscribe link for emails with certain headers, unfortunately this doesn't apply to a lot of emails that I want to unsubscribe from.

When the gmail unsubscribe link is missing, this extension adds it and when clicked opens a new tab with any unsubscribe links found in the body of the message.

Installation

TODO: pending submission to app store

Future enhancements
-------------------

 - Add a "mute" option to the unsubscribe modal that lets you filter out future messages from sender
 - Keyboard shortcuts?
